 # History:
 # 2005 ?? - 1.0
 #   first version
 # 2009-08-12 - 1.1
 #   thanks to ujqm8360@netwtc.net for helping fix a few bugs:
 #     - -ab x where -b accepts arguments wasn't handled properly. Also,
 #       $OPTLIND wasn't set properly (at least not the same way as most
 #       getopts implementation do).
 #     - The handling of ambiguous long options was incorrect.
