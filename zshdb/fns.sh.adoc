DETAILS
-------

Script Body
~~~~~~~~~~~

Has 10 line(s). No functions are called (may set up e.g. a hook, a Zle widget bound to a key, etc.).

_Dbg_copies
~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 # Return $2 copies of $1. If successful, $? is 0 and the return value
 # is in result.  Otherwise $? is 1 and result ''
____

Has 10 line(s). Doesn't call other functions.

Uses feature(s): _eval_

Called by:

 processor.sh/_Dbg_process_commands
 test-fns.sh/test_fns_copies

_Dbg_defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 # _Dbg_defined returns 0 if $1 is a defined variable or nonzero otherwise. 
____

Has 2 line(s). Doesn't call other functions.

Called by:

 examine.sh/_Dbg_do_examine
 export.sh/_Dbg_do_export
 test-fns.sh/test_fns_defined

_Dbg_esc_dq
~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 # Add escapes to a string $1 so that when it is read back using
 # eval echo "$1" it is the same as echo $1.
____

Has 1 line(s). Doesn't call other functions.

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

_Dbg_eval_extract_condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 # Removes "[el]if" .. "; then" or "while" .. "; do" or "return .."

____
 # _Dbg_get_typeset_attr echoes a list of all of the functions matching
 # optional pattern if $1 is nonzero, include debugger functions,
 # i.e. those whose name starts with an underscore (_Dbg), are included in
 # the search.  
 # A grep pattern can be specified to filter function names. If the 
 # pattern starts with ! we report patterns that don't match.

 #   int
 #   file:line
 #   function-num
 # Return triple (line,  is-function?, filename,) stored in array

 # We return the filename last since that can have embedded blanks.
____
