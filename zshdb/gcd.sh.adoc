 #!/usr/bin/env zsh
 # Greatest Common Divisor in POSIX shell using Euclid's algorithm.  On
 # return, variable gcd_value is set and is the gcd of parameters $1
 # and $2. The GCD of a negative number is the same as the GCD of its
 # absolute value, since a negative number is -1 times its positive
 # value.  Negative numbers are set when there is an error; -1 is set
 # when the wrong number of parameters are given.
